## 🧠 How the Solver Works

The solver uses a combination of techniques:
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Evaluates possible moves to maximize scores.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimizes the Minimax algorithm by reducing unnecessary calculations.
- **Iterative Deepening**: Searches the game tree progressively to find the best move.
